/*
    ARRAYS PRACTICE
    
    Create a program that asks the user to enter a planet.
    After the user enters a name of a planet, the program should print out that planet's position relative to the sun.
    You may only use one if statement and one for loop to complete this practice problem.
    When finished with this practice, move on to the assignment "ArraysChallenge"

    >Please enter a planet
    >Earth
